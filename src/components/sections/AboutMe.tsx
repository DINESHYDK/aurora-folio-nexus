          <p>
            I'm Dinesh Krishna, a Computer Science Engineering student at IIT
            (ISM) Dhanbad. I love solving problems and often find myself coding
            late into the night.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interests span competitive programming, web development, and data
            structures and algorithms. I enjoy turning ideas into clean, useful
            products.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm focused on growing into a well-rounded fullâ€‘stack developer and
            building things that make a real difference.
          </p>
